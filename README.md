# hibernate-quiz

This project was made for the summarizer #43 from 2024_07_09 at Code for All_ bootcamp #100 (prepared overnight) and it consists of a quiz about the introduction of Object Relational Mapping and to Hibernate. The library Prompt-view was used for user interface and uses Hibernate framework (rather rudimentary): questions, answers, solutions and explanations were stored in a database.
